## Design

### Colour Scheme

The main colours used are yellow (#eecf71), black and white, these colours compliment each other well, producing a clean, bold design.

### Typography

The Permanent Marker and Overpass fonts are the main fonts used throughout the whole website. Cursive is the fallback for Permanent Marker, and sans serif for Overpass, in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Permanent Marker is a bold and playful font suited well for a game/ quiz, Overpass is a simple but attractive font making it perfect for a question and answer format.

### Imagery

- The background image used throught the quiz is a photograph of a speaker wall, which fits the theme of the quiz and makes for an interesting background.
- The [favicon](https://github.com/EJDiamond/Music-Trivia/blob/main/assets/images/favicon.png), matches the theme of the page, using the yellow background with a musical note representing the music trivia. 

### Wireframe

The [wireframes](https://github.com/EJDiamond/Music-Trivia/blob/main/assets/images/wireframe-music-trivia.png) show the intial page where the user can select to play, read rules or view the leaderboard. Once 'play' is selected the player then has the option to select a level, intially only the first level is unlocked and once passed, level two will be available, with level three being accessed once the second level is passed.

The quiz is opened once the level is selected, taking the user to the first question. When an answer is hovered over the slection turns white, if the answer selected is correct it will turn green, if incorrect, it will turn red.

The option to exit the quiz is presented as a button at each stage.
