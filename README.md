## Design

### Colour Scheme
The main colours used are yellow (#eecf71), black and white, these colours compliment each other well, producing a clean, bold design.

### Typography
The Permanent Marker and Overpass fonts are the main fonts used throughout the whole website. Cursive is the fallback for Permanent Marker, and sans serif for Overpass, in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Permanent Marker is a bold and playful font suited well for a game/ quiz, Overpass is a simple but attractive font making it perfect for a question and answer format.

### Imagery
- The background image used throught the quiz is a photograph of a speaker wall, which fits the theme of the quiz and makes for an interesting background.
- The [favicon](https://github.com/EJDiamond/Music-Trivia/blob/main/favicon.png), matches the theme of the page, using the yellow background with a musical note representing the music trivia.
